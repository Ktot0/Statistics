# Week 4


## Objectives:

* Research
1. Illustrate the parallel between the properties of the relative frequencies and the axioms for probability.
2. Discuss some concept examples of Measure Space (, , P).
3. Illustrate how Measure Theory provides the mathematical foundation for Probability theory.

* Application
1. Simulate a sequence of coin-tosses (0 success, 1 unsuccess) and draw a dynamic chart of the relative frequency of a success fs=ms/m, absolutte frequency ms, Normalized frequency ms/sqrt(m).

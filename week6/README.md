# Week 6


## Objectives:

* Research

1. Try to explain in your own words the concept of population and sampling distribution
2. Show the expected value and variance of the sampling mean and take a look at the same sampling variance

* Application

1. Take any population and any variable X and draw m (large) samples of size n (as you like) and represent the following 2 distributions: Distribution of the mean and distribution of the variance. Finally, for each distribution compute mean and variance and compare the corrisponding values in the population.

* Research on App

# Week 5


## Objectives:

* Research

1. Explain all possible derivation of the arithmetic mean and in general of the other common types of averages
2. Illustrate the difference between "mathematical convergence" and "convergence" in probability
3. Illustrate the differences between Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics and the role of probability and probability distributions

* Application

1. Given an arbitrary rectangle and a distribution, create the corresponding histogram or column chart, with both vertical and horizontal orientation
2. Given a rectangle, enable its movement/resize/zoom using a mouse (this will be the resizable where we will draw alll future charts)

* Research on App

## Assignment
### Research

1. Explain all possible derivation of the arithmetic mean and in general of the other common types of averages.

* #### Geometric Mean

    The geometric mean is a mean which indicates the central tendency of a set of numbers using their product, while the arithmetic mean uses their sum. It is  particularly useful when dealing with numbers that need to be multiplied or numbers that are exponential.
    
    $$(\prod_{i=1}^{n} x_1)^{1/n}=\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 ... x_n}$$

* #### Harmonic Mean

    The harmonic mean is a particular kind of Pythagorean mean.  It can be expressed as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocal of all observations.
    
    $$H = \frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_2}+...+\frac{1}{x_n}}$$

* #### Power Mean

    If $p$ is a non-zero real number, and $x_1,...,x_n$ are positive real numbers their power mean is:

    $$M_p(x_1,...,x_n)=(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{x_i^p})^{1/p}$$


2. Illustrate the difference between "mathematical convergence" and "convergence" in probability.


3. Illustrate the differences between Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics and the role of probability and probability distributions

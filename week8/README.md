## Objectives:

* Research

1. Consider X (radius), Y (angle) uniform r.vs. and use them to determine points on a plane as image. Determine the empirical distribution of the Cartesian coordinates (Application). Search on the web about this problem.
1. Search for the methods to generate a NORMAL r.v. X, and simulate (Application) the following distribution: X, $X^2$ , $X/Y^2$, $X^2/Y^2$, $X/Y$.

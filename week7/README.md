1. Try to understand the general idea of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral and why it is useful concept and notation in Theory of Probability
2. Explain in your own words the "Law of large numbers" and sketch a simple proof (Markov inequality, Čebyšëv inequality, ... )

* Application

1. Consider a general scheme ad the simulation of previous homework and simulate the distribution of p = SUM(xi) , where xi are Bernoulli(lambda/n), with success probability lambda /n, where lambda is a user constant ("arrival rate").Also plot the distribution of the "interarrival times".Finally, search on the web to understand what you have actually simulated

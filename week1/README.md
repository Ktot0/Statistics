# Week 1


## Objectives:

* Research
1. Definition of statistics.
2. What is a dataset? From the observation units to the dataset attributes and values.
3. Find intresting application of statistics in cybersecurity.

* Application
1. Create a simple application in C# and VB.net


* Research on App
1. Main differences between C# and VB.net

## Assignment
### Research
* Statistics is a scientific discipline that handles the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
For this purpose, data are collected in datasets and organized in tables where every row represents a record and every column represents a variable. In statistics, a single element of the analysis is called a unit. Each row corresponds to a unit.
Thanks to organized datasets and through math statistics can be used to create a model to predict certain reality behaviour.
Statistics may be applied to reach security goals as well. As an example, we can use statistics to predict the shortest path to take in order to gain control of a network presenting hosts affected by vulnerabilities, or we can obtain a behavioural model of the users in our network.


### App
* Load data from a simple file [test.csv](https://github.com/Ktot0/Statistics/blob/main/week1/test.csv)
* Perform some basic operations (Min, Max, Avg).

[VB.Net Release](https://github.com/Ktot0/Statistics/tree/main/week1/Exercise_1_vb)

### Research on App
* Main differences so far between VB and C# are:

1. VB uses natural English words as markers, whereas C# uses keywords or symbols.
2. VB is not case-sensitive, C# is case-sensitive.
3. VB event handling is simpler.
4. In C# each statement ends with a semicolon.
5. It is easy to write VB code with the use of implicit casting.
6. VB uses "Me" to refer to the current object while C# uses "this".

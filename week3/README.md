# Week 3


## Objectives:

* Research
1. Illustrate the concept of conditional joint, marginal (relative) frequency using a simple bivariate distribution.
2. Illustrate the concept of statistical independence and the resulting mathematical relationship between the above frequencies.

* Application
1. Create a distribution from the data obtained by Wireshark reading the CSV generated by the program.

* Research on App
1. A survey on online algorithms (Welford)
2. In particular, Knuth recursione for the computation of the arithmetic mean.

### App


[Wireshark CSV distribution](https://github.com/Ktot0/Statistics/tree/main/week2/Week2_EX1)


### Research on App
* As for Wikipedia, an online algorithm can process the input as it is fed without knowing the whole. Because of its nature, an online algorithm is forced to make decisions that may lead to an incorrect result which is why the main focus in online algorithm development is to create meaningful results through decision-making techniques.

* Following simple mathematics, the mean value of a variable can be obtained by dividing the sum of all values the variable assumes in a statistical population by the dimension of the population itself. To reduce numerical error in the total Donald Knuth developed an online algorithm to calculate the mean iteratively. Knuth's algorithm updates the mean computed with the first n-1 inputs when a new X is received.

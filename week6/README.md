# Week 6


## Objectives:

* Research

1. Try to explain in your own words the concept of population and sampling distribution
2. Show the expected value and variance of the sampling mean and take a look at the same sampling variance

* Application

1. Take any population and any variable X and draw m (large) samples of size n (as you like) and represent the following 2 distributions: Distribution of the mean and distribution of the variance. Finally, for each distribution compute mean and variance and compare the corrisponding values in the population.

* Research on App

## Assignment
### Research

1. Try to explain in your own words the concept of population and sampling distribution

    In statistics, we refer to a population as a complete set of individuals with a common characteristic, while a sample is a smaller portion of said population extracted using sampling techniques. A sample must reflect its original population characteristics. For this reason, a statistical analysis of a sample must report the approximate standard deviation, or standard error, of its results from the entire population. 
A sampling distribution is a probability distribution of a statistic obtained from a larger set of samples drawn from a specific population. The sampling distribution of a given population is the distribution of frequencies of a range of different outcomes that could occur for a statistic of a population. As an example, we consider a population with mean and variance. We continuously take samples of size N and calculate the arithmetic mean for each sample or sample mean. We call "sampling distribution of the sample means" the distribution of the sample means.

# Week 5


## Objectives:

* Research

1. Explain all possible derivation of the arithmetic mean and in general of the other common types of averages
2. Illustrate the difference between "mathematical convergence" and "convergence" in probability
3. Illustrate the differences between Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics and the role of probability and probability distributions

* Application

1. Given an arbitrary rectangle and a distribution, create the corresponding histogram or column chart, with both vertical and horizontal orientation
2. Given a rectangle, enable its movement/resize/zoom using a mouse (this will be the resizable where we will draw alll future charts)

* Research on App
